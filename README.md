# No.js
No.js is a JS runtime written by V8 and Libuv. Just for fun.

# Usage
1. Run `sh install.sh` to build the deps, you will see "hello world" if build successfully.
2. Create JS file in current project dir or subdir, then run `./No your_file.js`.

# Develop
Modify the source code and run `make`, then test your code.
